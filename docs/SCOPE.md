## TailoredTasks AI
### Project Scope
**TailoredTasks AI** focuses solely on generating personalized study schedules
based on user input (assignments and study habits). The program does not perform
tasks outside of this scope, ensuring that it remains targeted and useful for
its purpose. The app uses a single AI model through the LLMProxy API to generate
schedules, avoiding unnecessary complexity. By limiting functionality to
scheduling and prioritization, the app remains simple, creative, and effective,
helping users achieve their goal of managing their study plans without engaging
in unrelated tasks or answering off-topic questions.
