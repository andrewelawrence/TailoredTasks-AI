## TailoredTasks AI
### Project Objectives
- You have to incorporate one or more prompt engineering strategies.
- You should have clear use-cases where prompt engineering does help vs where
  it doesn't.
- Your program should not answer any question/perform any task that is outside
of its scope (e.g., it shouldn't answer a math question if you have a built a
health chatbot). Be creative and think about how you can make it simpler and
more useful for the user to achieve the desired goal. 
- A console based interface and being able to run it on your machine are the
minimum requirements. Bonus credit if you want to make it accessible via a
web-server/website with a nice user interface. 
- This assignment is done individually; please bring your laptop and working
code to the class; you may also be asked to give a quick demo to the whole
class.
